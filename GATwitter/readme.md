# Tableau Analysis of General Assembly Tweets

This is the repo for my medium blog Tableau Analysis of General Assembly Tweets

* The .py file is what I used to collect and store the tweets from the General Assembly location list. This .py file can serve as a template for collecting tweets from any list if edited. The tweets are stored in a MySQL database.
* The csv files are what was collected. All csvs are joinable by Tweet ID.
